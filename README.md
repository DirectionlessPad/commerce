CS50 Web Programming project 2
https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/

Essentially a rudimentary implementation of an auction web-app.

Over the requirements of the CS50 project:
- Implemented favicon, just an old picture I had on my computer.
- Used crispy_forms to style create new listing form directly from the django ModelForm.

Could still be improved:
- Aesthetics, spend more time playing with various styles options (especially forms/buttons).
- HTML/CSS, could improve the organisation of styling.
- Login/Register, I havent't changed these views or html files from those supplied in the start code from CS50 and so it doesn't match the formatting or implementation of the rest of the app.
